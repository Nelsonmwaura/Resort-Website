    <p><strong>What you'l find here? ,</strong>is a full service holiday lodging facility, located at the seaside, with access to a private beach. The beach being the primary focus for tourists. A Beach Resort offers a wide range of services and amenities and typically includes entertainment and recreational activities.  As a self-contained establishment, a Beach Resort provides for most of a vacationer’s needs while remaining on the premises (lodging, food, drink, sports, entertainment, shopping, etc.).
  </div>
  <br></br>The benefits of booking a Beach Resort are that the guest finds not only the proximity to the beach but also an all-around service within the premises. It is convenient for families, offering kids-club, evening entertaining program, shopping etc. In cases the Resort is located far away from the city, the Resort provides all the infrastructure needed (it is a ‘village’ itself). Often a Beach Resort is used as a wedding location (with a beach setting ceremony, wedding planner on side, a photographer, a hairdresser and a beauty salon etc.). </p>
